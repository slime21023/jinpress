# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements to complete the JinPress static site generator project. JinPress is a Python-native static site generator inspired by VitePress, designed to be fast, lightweight, and elegantly configured. The project currently has a solid foundation but needs several critical fixes and missing components to be fully functional according to its README specification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JinPress CLI to work correctly with all commands, so that I can initialize, build, and serve documentation sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `jinpress init my-project` THEN the system SHALL create a new project with proper directory structure and sample content
2. WHEN I run `jinpress build` in a project directory THEN the system SHALL generate static HTML files in the dist/ directory
3. WHEN I run `jinpress serve` in a project directory THEN the system SHALL start a development server with live reload
4. WHEN I run `jinpress info` in a project directory THEN the system SHALL display project information
5. IF the CLI entry point is misconfigured THEN the system SHALL be updated to use the correct entry point function

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the markdown renderer to correctly process markdown files with front matter and syntax highlighting, so that my documentation looks professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a markdown file with YAML front matter THEN the system SHALL extract the front matter and render the markdown content
2. WHEN I include code blocks with language specification THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting using Pygments
3. WHEN I use markdown links ending in .md THEN the system SHALL transform them to pretty URLs
4. WHEN I use custom containers (tip, warning, danger, info) THEN the system SHALL render them with appropriate styling
5. IF the renderer method signatures are incorrect THEN the system SHALL be fixed to match expected interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme engine to properly load templates and static files, so that the generated site has the correct styling and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds a site THEN the theme engine SHALL load templates from the correct directories
2. WHEN the system builds a site THEN the theme engine SHALL copy static assets to the output directory
3. WHEN custom templates exist in the project THEN the system SHALL prioritize them over default theme templates
4. WHEN rendering pages THEN the system SHALL provide complete template context with site and page data
5. IF template loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want syntax highlighting to work correctly in code blocks, so that code examples are readable and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I include code blocks with language specification THEN the system SHALL generate proper HTML with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN the system builds a site THEN it SHALL include syntax highlighting CSS styles
3. WHEN I specify line highlighting (e.g., `{1,3-5}`) THEN the system SHALL highlight the specified lines
4. WHEN no language is specified THEN the system SHALL render plain code blocks without highlighting
5. IF Pygments CSS is missing THEN the system SHALL generate and include appropriate styles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the search functionality to work correctly, so that users can find content in the generated documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds a site THEN it SHALL generate a search index JSON file
2. WHEN users type in the search box THEN the system SHALL display relevant results
3. WHEN users click on search results THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct page
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL display a "no results" message
5. IF the search index is empty or missing THEN the search functionality SHALL gracefully handle the error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to work with live reload, so that I can see changes immediately during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the development server THEN it SHALL serve the built site on the specified host and port
2. WHEN I modify markdown files THEN the system SHALL automatically rebuild and reload the browser
3. WHEN I modify configuration files THEN the system SHALL rebuild the site
4. WHEN I modify theme files THEN the system SHALL rebuild and update the site
5. IF file watching fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass, so that I can be confident the system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the test suite THEN all existing tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN the renderer is tested THEN it SHALL correctly process markdown files
3. WHEN the config system is tested THEN it SHALL properly load and validate configuration
4. WHEN the builder is tested THEN it SHALL successfully build sites
5. IF test method signatures are incorrect THEN they SHALL be updated to match the implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be properly packaged and installable, so that users can install it via pip.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users install the package THEN the CLI command SHALL be available globally
2. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL include all necessary files and dependencies
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN all theme assets SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN users import jinpress modules THEN they SHALL work correctly
5. IF the package configuration is incorrect THEN it SHALL be fixed to ensure proper installation
